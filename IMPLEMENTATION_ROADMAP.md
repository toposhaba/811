## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Microservices vs Monolith
**Decision**: Hybrid approach with modular monolith
**Rationale**:
- Faster initial development
- Easier debugging and deployment
- Can be split into microservices later
- Lower operational complexity

### 2. Database Choice
**Decision**: DynamoDB as primary database
**Rationale**:
- Serverless, no maintenance overhead
- Automatic scaling
- Good fit for document-style data
- Cost-effective for variable load

### 3. AI/ML Platform
**Decision**: Amazon Bedrock with LLama 2
**Rationale**:
- Managed service reduces complexity
- LLama 2 has strong form understanding
- Integration with AWS ecosystem
- Pay-per-use pricing model

### 4. Integration Approach
**Decision**: Adapter pattern with plugin architecture
**Rationale**:
- Easy to add new districts
- Isolated failure domains
- Testable components
- Flexible submission methods

### 5. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard
- Salesforce compatible
- Stateless authentication
- Good security practices
